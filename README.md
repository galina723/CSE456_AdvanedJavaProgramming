### Lab 4

1. Is the layered design reasonable?

The design is generally good. The layers—presentation, service, and data—are separated, which makes the system easier to understand and maintain. The presentation layer handles input, the service layer has the business logic, and the data layer manages transactions.

\*\* Strengths:
One of the best things about the design is that it allows you to add new payment methods without changing the existing system. This makes the system flexible and easy to extend. The use of dependency injection also makes it easy to switch payment methods, keeping the different parts of the system independent. This is helpful for both testing and future changes.

\*\* Suggestions for Improvement:
However, there are some areas for improvement. First, the payment methods and the service layer are tightly connected. Using a Strategy Pattern would help reduce this, making it easier to add new payment methods without changing the service layer. Also, the system needs better error handling and logging to deal with payment failures. The Transaction object could be improved by adding more details, such as user information and timestamps. Finally, to make the system easier to test, it would be useful to create mockable interfaces for the payment methods and repositories.
